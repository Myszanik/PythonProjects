# Project Overview

The PythonProjects directory contains three subfolders, each focusing on different aspects of Python programming:

BasicScripts: Fundamental Python scripts covering algorithms and basic input/output operations.
GameDevelopmentScripts: Scripts for creating simple games using Python, including both text-based and GUI-based games.
ExpenseTrackerScripts: Scripts for tracking expenses and calculating individual shares of a bill.


## Folder Structure
BasicScripts: Contains scripts focusing on core Python concepts and algorithms.
GameDevelopmentScripts: Includes scripts for developing games with Python.
ExpenseTrackerScripts: Provides solutions for managing and tracking expenses.


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- pygame (if used, typically needs to be installed separately)


## How to run
1. Clone this repository or download the Python files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file you want to run.
4. Execute the script using the command: python3 name_of_file.py

  Note: On some systems, you may need to use python instead of python3

Each script in these subfolders is designed to be run independently. Ensure Python is installed on your machine and run each script from the command line or an IDE of your choice.
