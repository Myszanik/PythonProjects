Project Overview

The PythonProjects directory contains three subfolders, each focusing on different aspects of Python programming: BasicScripts, GameDevelopmentScripts, and ExpenseTrackerScripts. Each subfolder contains scripts that serve as examples or solutions to specific problems within their respective domains.

Folder Structure
BasicScripts: Contains fundamental Python scripts focusing on algorithms and basic input/output operations.
GameDevelopmentScripts: Contains scripts related to creating simple games using Python, including text-based and GUI-based games.
ExpenseTrackerScripts: Contains scripts for tracking expenses and calculating individual shares of a bill.


How to Use
Each script in these subfolders is designed to be run independently. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine, and then execute each script from the command line or an IDE of your choice.
